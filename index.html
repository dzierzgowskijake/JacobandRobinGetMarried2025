        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Well, we went to the same college…during COVID. So while we technically shared a school, we never actually shared a classroom—or even a campus. Thanks to remote learning, a portion of our college experience happened entirely from behind a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            But fate (and Instagram) had other plans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robin had a virtual class with one of Jacob’s best friends. Naturally, like any curious online student, she ended up doing a little social media exploring. That’s when she stumbled across Jacob’s account. She followed. He followed back. And just like that, the story began.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started talking soon after and quickly became best friends. For almost a full year, we texted, FaceTimed, and talked about anything and everything. Even though we’d never met in person, we somehow felt like we’d known each other forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then finally, we met. No screens, no buffering, just us. And from that very first day, we’ve been inseparable. Nearly every single day since has been spent together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Four years later, we’re still best friends, still cracking each other up, and still amazed that one random follow led us to exactly where we were meant to be.
